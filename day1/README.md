What I learnt today:

1. Understood the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why it's essential for modern cloud automation.

2. Learned what Terraform is and how it helps manage cloud resources declaratively.

3. Explored key Terraform features like providers, state files, execution plans, and HCL syntax.

4. Understood the Terraform workflow: init → validate → plan → apply → destroy.

5. Set up the Terraform environment and prepared to start hands-on from Day 1.
